# RtweetsAnalytics

This project uses various ideas to present twitter's data. Most of
these ideas can be easily found on internet and I have selected ones
that I or people I work for find useful.

I use data base created by RtweetsDb:
https://github.com/sbartek/RtweetsDb

Therefore, these project should be used together.

Features:
* Create graph of tweets where the relation between tweets is the
following: tweet1 -> tweet2 if tweet2 is a retweet of tweet1.
* Plot the graph
* Export graph to gephi
